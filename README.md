# Introduction

This website has been designed to advise service users on how to identify zombies, improve their odds of survival during a zombie outbreak and help connect with fellow zombie survival enthusiasts.

The information based on this website is fictional being as zombies are currently fictional. All zombie information has been obtained from various films, books, tv shows and other media thought the years. All **Survival** information is based on real proven survival skills I have learnt throughout my training with the scouts

This is my first milestone project with the Code Institute on the Full Stack Web Devlopment Program the main aim is to produce a responsive website with a minimum of three pages using **CSS** and **HTML5**

# Design

## Colour Scheme

I wanted to use army/survival coloring based on traditional colours.

<details><summary>Army color palette inspiration </summary><img src="assets/readme-assets/army-camo-palette.webp"></details>  
The core colours I used were Green(#4a572c) Beige(#fcf1c8) Navy(#1e3030), black(#FFFFFF) and white(#000000).  
<details><summary>main colours ratio</summary><img src="assets/readme-assets/green-beige-contrast.webp"></details>

## Typography

I didn't want the fonts to be too distracting so I limited my fonts to three of the following;

- Roboto Condensed
- Roboto Flex
- Anton

with sans-serif as the default backup.

## Site theme

I wanted the overall site to not distract the visitors from the information provided. A minimalist aesthetic has been adopted, using simple fonts and complementing colouring. I chose to incorporate high-quality images throughout the entire website attempting to avoid low-quality images and illustrations. I also avoided overusing visual effects as some users find them too distacting.

## Skeleton

A physical sketchbook was used to create the first draft of a wireframe as it provided a very fast easily modifiable platform for a rough design plan.Once I was happy with the basic design I produced a digital wireframe using Balsamiq.

As I started to develop my website I was unhappy with my original designs; for example, I wanted my home page to be more captivating but once I built the page I felt that my first design was too distracting. I amended my frameworks after completing my homepage as I felt that my new design style better matched my original goals for the project. I didn't make a wireframe for the sign-up page as I originally wanted to have a form at the end of a page. I decided for a more clean look and opted for a modal form making use of a call-to-action button on the first page and accessible from a footer on every other page.

Overall I enjoyed the design development stage of the project and I felt letting my design organically grow and not restricting myself to the first design produced a better outcome for the project.
